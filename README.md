# [SF Movies](https://65f562f9cdbd1698345325ad--graceful-taiyaki-62a996.netlify.app/)

## Description
SF Movies is a web application that allows users to search for movies filmed in San Francisco. It provides information about the movies, including their titles, release years, and production companies.

## Solution Focus
The solution is front-end, utilizing React for the front-end, Redux for state management


## Technical Choices
- React: Chosen for its component-based architecture, which facilitates modular development and reusability of code.
- Redux: Used to manage application state and ensure a single source of truth for data across components.
- Leaflet: Utilized for displaying maps and markers to visualize the filming locations of movies in San Francisco.

## Trade off
Right now, the app works smoothly without a back-end, but it depends on another service for its data. This means it can't do some things like remembering user preferences or handling lots of users at once.

## Future Improvements
Making Search Better: We can make it easier for people to find movies by adding more search options like genres or years.
Making It Work on Phones: We can make sure the app looks good and works well on phones and tablets too.
Making It Faster: We can make the app faster by finding better ways to get and show the movie information.
